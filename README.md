# Job-Functions-Recommendation
In this project we create machine learning model to recommend the job functions in which an employee with a specific job title can work.

# Getting Started

## Project Overview
Job functions and job titles are very different things. A job title is essentially
the name of a position within an organization filled by an employee. Job
function is the routine set of tasks or activities undertaken by a person in
that position. An employee's title and function are often closely related,
though not all job functions are clear based on title alone.

So, in this project we will build a machine learning model to recommend new job functions for an employee based on his
job title and then we deploy this service as a **Flask API**
